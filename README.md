## Intermediate-JavaScript-Password-Generator

This week’s Challenge required me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected.

# Description

I have create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code. The app has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation
 
 NA 

# Usage

A password generator app is a tool that creates random, secure passwords for users. These passwords can be used for various online accounts and services, such as email, social media, and banking. To use a password generator app, the user typically inputs the desired password length and the types of characters (e.g. uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) they want to include. The app then generates a password that meets those specifications. Users can then copy and paste the generated password into the appropriate field when creating or updating their online account. It's important to note that users should store their password in a secure location, such as a password manager, to avoid forgetting them.
